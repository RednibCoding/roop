### 1. Setup your platform

- [Linux](1.1-Setup-Linux.md)
- [MacOS](1.2-Setup-MacOS.md)
- [Windows](1.3-Setup-Windows.md)

### 2. Clone Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/RednibCoding/roop
```

### 3. Install dependencies

We highly recommend to work with a venv or conda to avoid issues.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Download model

Download the [model](https://mega.nz/file/i6ZGBLIR#u3zPnWwSOTdk__uFfwsEQIOmjDRUTVdKqEn7rUHzr5U) and put it into the root directory of the cloned repo

### 4. Done

You should be able to run roop using `python run.py` command. Keep in mind that while running the program for first time, it will download some models which can take time depending on your network connection.
